Link Card Tutorial

Follow the instructions on the landing screen to get started.
After you've set up a profile, you will need another person to link with.
Swipe the left side of the screen or open the navigator view on the top right to toggle which accounts you'd like to share.
To view how your Link Card will appear to others, swipe back to your Profile screen.
If you're connected to the same Wi-Fi network, simply press the Link logo on your Link screen.
If not, swipe over to Connect and scan the other person's QR code (take a picture afterwards if you like:).
After linked, swipe over to the Cards screen and view their Link Card. 
And that's it! You can delete the Link Card or change the photo if you press their profile image. 

Additionally you can goto the Shop once you've saved enough coins (or buy some if you wish in the Exchange, I sure do:).
These products have individual expiration dates but once purchased or found as a treasure,
the customization will transfer over in your Link Card on other people's devices when you connect.

And that's really it. Happy Linking!
